**2. Goal**

In this project, we will create a simple but functional website that allows to play and sell games. Developer will be able to link their games into the website and set a price for the sell. Gamers will be able to buy the games and play directly in the website. The Website will create a game library for each user and collects some basic statistics about the games.

Our initial focus go to the backend in order to create the structures which allow the website to run.
